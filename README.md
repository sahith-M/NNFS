# Neural Networks from Scratch (NNFS)
This repository contains my implementations of neural networks from scratch using NumPy, based on the book "Neural Networks from Scratch".

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **notebooks/** â†’ Jupyter Notebooks for each chapter.
- **scripts/** â†’ Python scripts for implementations.
- **datasets/** â†’ Training datasets used.
- **results/** â†’ Saved training graphs and model evaluations.

## ðŸš€ Implemented Features
- [] Perceptron
- [] Forward Propagation
- [] Backpropagation (In Progress)
- [] Multi-layer Neural Networks

## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions
